# [PROGRAM NAME] TBD
We are going to create a python game. The game will have a player and an enemy. The player will have a choice of attacks while the enemy will give a random attack. The attacks will determine the (health) of both, player and enemy, and the level of the game ends when either one of the two “health bars” hits zero. We are planning on starting with three levels (easy, medium, and hard).
More information coming...
